  description: |
      This tutorial guides you through the preprocessing of sequencing data of
      bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples obtained from early COVID-19
      patients in China. Since such samples are expected to be contaminated
      signficantly with human sequenced reads, the goal is to enrich the data
      for SARS-CoV-2 reads by identifying and discarding reads of human origin
      before trying to assemble the viral genome sequence.

      Terrestrial ecosystem models have been widely used to study the impact of
      climate changes on vegetation and terrestrial biogeochemical cycles in
      climate modelling community. They are also more and more applied in
      ecological studies to help ecologists to better understand the processes.
      But the technical challenges are still too high for most of the
      ecologists to use them. This practical aims at familiarizing you
      (especially ecologists) with running a terrestrial ecosystem model (i.e.,
      CLM-FATES) at site-level in Galaxy and analyzing the model results.

epigenetics-atac-seq-tutorial:
  description: |
      In many eukaryotic organisms, such as humans, the genome is tightly
      packed and organized with the help of nucleosomes (chromatin). A
      nucleosome is a complex formed by eight histone proteins that is wrapped
      with ~147bp of DNA. When the DNA is being actively transcribed into RNA,
      the DNA will be opened and loosened from the nucleosome complex. Many
      factors, such as the chromatin structure, the position of the
      nucleosomes, and histone modifications, play an important role in the
      organization and accessibility of the DNA. Consequently, these factors
      are also important for the activation and inactivation of genes. Assay
      for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-Seq) is a
      method to investigate the accessibility of chromatin and thus a method to
      determine regulatory mechanisms of gene expression. The method can help
      identify promoter regions and potential enhancers and silencers.

      Single-cell RNA-seq analysis is a rapidly evolving field at the forefront
      of transcriptomic research, used in high-throughput developmental studies
      and rare transcript studies to examine cell heterogeneity within a
      populations of cells. The cellular resolution and genome wide scope make
      it possible to draw new conclusions that are not otherwise possible with
      bulk RNA-seq. *Slides created by Mehmet Tekman*

      new cases of TB worldwide and 1.4 million deaths due to the disease, making
      TB the world's most deadly infectious disease. Variation in the genome
      of M. tuberculosis (Mtb) is associated with changes in phenotype, for example
      drug resistance and virulence. It is also useful for outbreak investigation
      as the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a sample can be used to build
      a phylogeny.
